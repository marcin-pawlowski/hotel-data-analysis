# hotel-data-analysis
## Data analysis project - SQL and Power BI

The aim of the analysis is to answer the questions posed by stakeholders:

- Is our hotel revenue growing by year?
- Should we increase our parking lot size?
- What trends can we see in data

The idea and data for the analysis came from the https://absentdata.com/ website.
